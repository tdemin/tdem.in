        <p>This has been a busy time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally finished with my internship at Nefteavtomatika, getting my
hands on an internal web service managing MAC address allocation
designed to provide an API for flashing software. Thanks to that I&rsquo;m now
a lot more familiar with building web in Go, and am eager to build more
things with it. &lt;3</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started looking at lot more into <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Yggdrasil</a>, a mesh
networking software. As of right now I&rsquo;m mainly using it as a VPN, as it
provides every node with a static /64 subnet, so IPv6 exploration is a
lot easier (as most of Russian ISPs don&rsquo;t even bother with providing
static prefixes to end users). The positive side effects of this are the
new <a href="/post/yggdrasil-systemd">guide</a> on configuring it with systemd-networkd and routing,
and a <a href="https://git.tdem.in/tdemin/syg_go">simple address miner</a> I wrote in Go. If you want a
neatly-looking Yggdrasil address, you now know what to do. :)</p>
<p>The work on Amber continues, this time mainly with
<a href="https://git.tdem.in/tdemin/amber_cli">amber_cli</a>, who has never gotten the love it deserved since
the very beginning of its development and now gets a complete
refactoring as at the time of starting the project I wasn&rsquo;t really
familiar with Go at all. There are also few corrections I&rsquo;d like to make
to API v0 and related algos before considering it done. <a href="https://git.tdem.in/tdemin/amber">Amber</a>
itself needs a huge overhaul, so does <a href="https://git.tdem.in/tdemin/amber_web">Amber Web</a>, who&rsquo;s
never seen a single update the last few months.</p>
<p>This blog itself has got an updateâ€”it is now hosted on my main domain,
<a href="/">tdem.in</a>, and orphaned links at <a href="https://blog.tdem.in">blog.tdem.in</a>
now lead here. The home page is now managed by Hugo as well, making the
effort in keeping it updated less of a time waste.</p>
<p>Looking good so far, looking forward to the last month of summer!</p>
