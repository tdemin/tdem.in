Just scrolled through the timeline Instagram generates for me. 20 "blog posts"
with boring "inspiring" descriptions trying to teach me life, 15 or about that
from the official accounts, no posts I'd consider personal (i.e. random fun
pics). Not even trying to open stories anymore, I don't really like being fed
with video ads every 3 or 4 posts. That's the cancer that ate Instagram.

The worst thing about this is that I can see the plague being spread to
Mastodon. Barely seen a mastodon.social account posting anything that would make
sense (not speaking of shitposting, at least it has some kind of personal
touch). It's not like I've seen many, yet I'm pretty sure I'd not lose anything
interesting, had the admins of my instance suddenly blocked federation with it.

The _truly_ worst thing about this is that I sometimes _do_ post things this
cancer-ish way (announces, news, etc). That's how the disease spreads. The slow
death of fun on the Internet, eh?
