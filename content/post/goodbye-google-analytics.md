Let’s say goodbye to Google Analytics on my blog.

There was no good reason to use it anyway, yet, like most of the users of analytics and tracking tools (say hello to Instagram where virtually everyone familiar enough with the social network uses a business profile with tracking enabled), I used it for my personal interest. So, to ease the GDPR compliance, I’m removing it altogether from the blog and my homepage.

No tracking anymore. ;)
