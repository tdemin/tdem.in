So this is it, I've finally moved my blog to a fully self-hosted solution.

This site is now generated with Hugo, is rebuilt on every commit to a private
repo on my own code hosting, and seems to work better than the hackish
host-with-Tumblr approach.

Oh, and one last thing: exporting posts from Tumblr is a PITA. Good thing I
didn't have lots of those.
